   - User session management across app restarts
   - Graceful degradation when embeddings unavailable

2. **🌐 Streamlit Web Interface** (`main_ui.py`)
   - Modern, responsive chat interface
   - Real-time memory indicators and session info
   - Full integration with memory and tool recommendation systems
   - Beautiful UI with sidebar status information

3. **🖥️ Command Line Interface** (`app.py`)
   - Terminal-based interaction with same functionality
   - Memory integration for persistent conversations
   - Maintains existing security analysis capabilities

4. **Tool Recommendation MCP Server** (`tool_recommendation/`)
   - 5 specialized functions for different recommendation workflows
   - Built using FastMCP pattern for modular architecture
   - Integrated with Brave Search API and Gemini AI

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. 🧠 Memory System Features
```python
