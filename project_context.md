### Project Summary

We're building an automated sports betting analysis pipeline that searches the web daily for expert picks and sports statistics to provide one optimized pick per day. The system will aggregate data from multiple sources, perform comprehensive analysis using AI tools, and utilize machine learning to learn from past predictions and improve accuracy over time.

### Technical Requirements

#### Data Collection:

- Daily web scraping for expert picks from sports betting analysts
- Real-time sports statistics from various sources
- News and sentiment analysis from sports media
- Historical data for backtesting and model training

#### Cloud Infrastructure:

- **Storage**: Cloud storage for raw data and processed datasets
- **Analytics**: Data warehousing and statistical analysis platform
- **ML Platform**: Machine learning services for training and deploying models
- **Automation**: Scheduled functions for daily data collection pipeline

#### Local Processing:

- Statistical analysis and data processing
- Machine learning models for prediction
- Decision engine combining multiple data sources
- Backtesting system for accuracy validation

#### Key Features:

- **Expert Opinion Analysis**: Aggregate and weight picks from multiple analysts
- **Statistical Modeling**: Team/player performance, injuries, weather, historical trends
- **AI Analysis**: Multiple AI tools for different aspects of game analysis
- **Learning System**: Continuous improvement based on prediction outcomes
- **Decision Engine**: Final pick based on comprehensive analysis

### Architecture Flow

1. **Daily Data Collection** → Automated scraping of expert picks and statistics
2. **Data Processing** → Clean, normalize, and store collected data
3. **Analysis** → Statistical analysis and ML predictions
